                    <p>Imagine an international gateway where goods and merchandise flow
                    across borders. Where countries lower taxes, reduce red tape, and eliminate
                    road blocks. Where companies import goods and merchandise directly into a Free 
                    Trade Zone - and then ship products out duty free.</p> 
                    
                    <p>The Miami Free Trade Zone connects
                     North America, Europe and Asia to Latin America and the Caribbean via direct air and 
                     sea transportation links, plus rafl and expressway. Operated by FTZ World Services, 
                     the 47-acre Zone (#372) saves companies money and time.</p>
